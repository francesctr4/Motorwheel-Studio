## GAME description:

Windjammers was released in 1994 by DataEast on the NEO GEO console 
and arcade system, and in Japan it was known as Flying Power Disc.

It's a sports arcade game that consists of two players versus 
each other (or a player vs the CPU) in a 2 dimensional field, 
similar to air hockey or the famous video game Pong, from which 
they take its mechanics. 

However, this game brings more movement freedom to the player 
and new mechanics such as the special throws or movable obstacles 
throughout the court.

- Objective:

The objective of the game is to be the best of three sets, winning each set by being the first to score 12 points 
or more by throwing the disk into the opponent's goal. You also win the set if you have more points than the other 
player and the time is up.

The red zone of each goal gives the player 500 points and the yellow
zone gives 300 points.

In case there is a draw at the final set, sudden death will occur, rewarding with the victory to the player
who manages to score in the opponents goal. If there is a draw at sudden death, both players will lose by the
result of "Draw Game".

- IMPORTANT:

The available characters are Hiromi Mita, Jordi Costa and Gary Scott and 
the playable maps are Beach, Concrete and Stadium.

- GAME controls:

The players can only move if they don't have the disk and only if they have received the disk from the arbit
at the beginning of the set. Players can't move between sets either.
